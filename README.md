# Advanced Topics in Communications || IIT Madras  



This repository contains the material used- references, assignments and tutorials- for the January - May 2021 offering of EE6143: Advanced Topics in Communications (5G NR) at IIT Madras for which I served as a Teaching Assistant. Taught by [Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/rganti/), this course covers the fundamentals of wireless communication and some of the 5G NR specifications. Broadly, the topics covered include-



-  OFDM
- 5G NR: time and frequency structure of data
- SSB, MIB and SIB
- TDD 
- PRACH
- FEC in 5G NR
- MIMO in 5G NR
- DMRS 
- RAN, 5G Core, QoS and slicing



## Contents

- **Assignment1**: a programming assignment that introduces students to MATLAB and has them simulate the waterfall curves for an AWGN channel

- **Assignment2**: a warm up theory assignment on random variables

- **Assignment3**: a programming assignment that involves the simulation of transmission using OFDM with AWGN and multipath fading channels

- **Assignment4**: a theory assignment on OFDM in the context of 5G NR

- **Assignment5**: a theory assignment on SIB, TDD and PRACH in 5G NR

- **Assignment6**: a programming assignment that involves the simulation of LDPC coded transmission using OFDM for an AWGN channel

- **Tutorial**: an introduction to MATLAB and some of the functions likely to be used in the assignments issued to the students
