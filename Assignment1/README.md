# Assignment 1

This assignment involves the simulation of a bits to bits communication system in the presence of an AWGN channel. BER vs SNR curves are obtained for different modulations- 4, 16, 64 and 256 QAM. Theoretical BER vs SNR curves are also obtained.

## Contents

- **```OFDM_ideal.m```**: A MATLAB script that simulates a bits to bits OFDM system. Even though the problem statement does not require that OFDM be implemented, this is done as it does not affect the results (FFT/IFFT does not affect Gaussian noise). The output is a plot of BER vs Eb by N0 for 4, 16, 64 and 256 QAM.
